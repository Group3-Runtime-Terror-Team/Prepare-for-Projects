## Pitch 1(favorite): HealthicHub 

### Problem Domain:
Many people face difficulty in moving from home to the nutritionist clinics centres, and some people face difficulty in memorizing and reviewing all their health information, their health status in a manner ongoing so the Application provides them with all the health services they need while saving their time.
The patient cannot reach the nutritionist; some of them canâ€™t open their clinics, and a lot of chaos happens. So, we collect many nutritionists in one application and online providing service is less paid than clinical.

### Summary of Idea:
The main goal of the Application is to help nutritionists and patients and to organize the relationship between them to get the required service with a good budget, good quality, and save time and effort.
It also provides many diverse health services:

2. Provide real-time interaction between patients and nutritionists.
3. Help nutritionists to store, manage, and track patients' medical records.
4. Save money, effort, and time for the users of the system, as all these are available online.

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Definition:
This MVP focuses on providing the essential functionalities required for the app to function effectively. It allows the admin to manage nutritionist profiles and posts, nutritionists to interact with patients, manage appointments and diet plans, and patients to search for, book appointments with, and communicate with nutritionists. The ability to track diet plans, calculate calories, and provide feedback adds value to the patient experience. Keep in mind that this MVP can serve as a foundation for further development and iteration based on user feedback and evolving needs.
Implement a simple and intuitive user interface (UI) design that allows users to navigate through the app and take quizzes easily.
